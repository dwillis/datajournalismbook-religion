# Aggregates

## Libraries

R is a statistical programming language that is purpose built for data analysis.

Base R does a lot, but there are a mountain of external libraries that do things to make R better/easier/more fully featured. We already installed the tidyverse -- or you should have if you followed the instructions for the last assignment -- which isn't exactly a library, but a collection of libraries. Together, they make up the Tidyverse. Individually, they are extraordinarily useful for what they do. We can load them all at once using the tidyverse name, or we can load them individually. Let's start with individually.

The two libraries we are going to need for this assignment are `readr` and `dplyr`. The library `readr` reads different types of data in. For this assignment, we're going to read in csv data or Comma Separated Values data. That's data that has a comma between each column of data.

Then we're going to use `dplyr` to analyze it.

To use a library, you need to import it. Good practice -- one I'm going to insist on -- is that you put all your library steps at the top of your notebooks.

That code looks like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
```

To load them both, you need to do this:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

But, because those two libraries -- and several others that we're going to use over the course of this class -- are so commonly used, there's a shortcut to loading all of the libraries we'll need:

```{r}
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
```

You can keep doing that for as many libraries as you need.

## Importing data

The first thing we need to do is get some data to work with. We do that by reading it in. In our case, we're going to read a datatable from a CSV file. A CSV is a stripped down version of a spreadsheet you might open in a program like Excel, in which each column is separated by a comma. There are other types of files that R can read, but CSVs are common and _mostly_ easy to work with.

The CSV we're going to work with is a list of tax-exempt churches in Maryland, from the Internal Revenue Service. It has information like the name of the organization, its address, city, state, zip code and different codes describing details about its status and organization. More information about those codes is available in the IRS documentation for exempt organizations, which you can find [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/eo-info.pdf).

So step 1 is to import the data. The code to import the data looks like this:

`md_churches <- read_csv("data/churches_md.csv")`

Let's unpack that.

The first part -- **md_churches** -- is the name of a variable we are creating.

A **variable** is just a name that we'll use to refer to some more complex thing. In this case, the more complex thing is the data we're importing into R that will be stored as a **dataframe**, which is one way R stores data.

We can call this variable whatever we want. The variable name doesn't matter, technically. We could use any word. You could use your first name, if you like. Generally, though, we want to give variables names that are descriptive of the thing they refer to. Which is why we're calling this one **md_churches**. Variable names, by convention are one word all lower case (or two or more words connected by an underscore). You can end a variable with a number, but you can't start one with a number.

The `<-` bit, you'll recall from the basics, is the **variable assignment operator**. It's how we know we're assigning something to a word. Think of the arrow as saying "Take everything on the right of this arrow and stuff it into the thing on the left." So we're creating an empty vessel called **md_churches** and stuffing all this data into it.

**read_csv()** is a function, one that only works when we've loaded the tidyverse. A **function** is a little bit of computer code that takes in information and follows a series of pre-determined steps and spits it back out. A recipe to make pizza is a kind of function. We might call it **make_pizza()**.

The function does one thing. It takes a preset collection of ingredients -- flour, water, oil, cheese, tomato, salt -- and passes them through each step outlined in a recipe, in order. Things like: mix flour and water and oil, knead, let it sit, roll it out, put tomato sauce and cheese on it, bake it in an oven, then take it out.

The output of our **make pizza()** function is a finished pie.

We'll make use of a lot of pre-written functions from the tidyverse and other packages, and even write some of our own. Back to this line of code:

`md_churches <- read_csv("data/churches_md.csv")`

Inside of the **read_csv()** function, we've put the name of the file we want to load. Things we put inside of function, to customize what the function does, are called **arguments**.

The easiest thing to do, if you are confused about how to find your data, is to put your data in the same folder as as your notebook (you'll have to save that notebook first). If you do that, then you just need to put the name of the file in there. If you put your data in a folder called "data" that sits next to your data notebook, your function would instead look like this:

```{r}
md_churches <- read_csv("data/churches_md.csv")
```

In this data set, each row represents a different church. Each column represents a different attribute of that church -- its name, address, city, state, zip code and so on.

After loading the data, it's a good idea to get a sense of its shape. What does it look like? There are several ways we can examine it.

By looking in the R Studio environment window, we can see the number of rows (called "obs.", which is short for observations), and the number of columns (called variables). We can double click on the dataframe name in the environment window, and explore it like a spreadsheet.

There are several useful functions for getting a sense of the dataset right in our markdown document.

If we run `glimpse(md_churches)`, it will give us a list of the columns, the data type for each column and and the first few values for each column.

```{r}
glimpse(md_churches)
```

If we type `head(md_churches)`, it will print out the columns and the first six rows of data.

```{r}
head(md_churches)
```

We can also click on the data name in the R Studio environment window to explore it interactively.

## Group by and count

So what if we wanted to know how many churches were in each city?

To do that by hand, we'd have to take each of the 7,314 individual rows (or observations or records) and sort them into a pile. We'd put them in groups -- one for each city -- and then count them.

`dplyr` has a group by function in it that does just this. A massive amount of data analysis involves grouping like things together and then doing simple things like counting them, or averaging them together. So it's a good place to start.

So to do this, we'll take our dataset and we'll introduce a new operator: `|>`. The best way to read that operator, in my opinion, is to interpret that as "and then do this." This is called the "pipe operator" and it's a huge part of writing R statements. So much so that there's a keyboard shortcut for this: cmd-shift-m on the Mac and ctrl-shift-m on Windows. In order to enable this shortcut, you'll need to set an option under Tools -\> Global Options, in the "Code" section. Make sure you check the box labeled "Use native pipe operator" and then click "Apply", like so:

![](images/rstudio_pipe_operator.png)

Don't like that character? R also has one that does the same thing: `%>%`. They both work.

We're going to establish a pattern that will come up again and again throughout this book: `data |> function`. In English: take your data set and then do this specific action to it.

The first step of every analysis starts with the data being used. Then we apply functions to the data.

In our case, the pattern that you'll use many, many times is: `data |> group_by(COLUMN NAME) |> summarize(VARIABLE NAME = AGGREGATE FUNCTION(COLUMN NAME))`

In our dataset, the column with city information is called `CITY`.

Here's the code to count the number of churches in each city:

```{r}
md_churches |>
  group_by(CITY) |>
  summarise(
    count = n()
  )
```

So let's walk through that.

We start with our dataset -- `md_churches` -- and then we tell it to group the data by a given field in the data. In this case, we wanted to group together all the cities, signified by the field name `CITY`, which you could get from using the glimpse() function. After we group the data, we need to count them up.

In dplyr, we use the `summarize()` function, [which can do alot more than just count things](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html).

Inside the parentheses in summarize, we set up the summaries we want. In this case, we just want a count of the number of classes for each term grouping. The line of code `count = n(),` says create a new field, called `count` and set it equal to the value of `n()`. `n()` is a function that counts the number of rows or records in each group. Why the letter n? The letter n is a common symbol used to denote a count of something. The number of things (or rows or observations or records) in a dataset? Statisticians call it n. There are n number of cities in this dataset.

When we run that, we get a list of cities with a count next to them. But it's not in any order.

So we'll add another "and then do this" symbol -- \|\> -- and use a new function called `arrange()`. Arrange does what you think it does -- it arranges data in order. By default, it's in ascending order -- smallest to largest. But if we want to know the term with the most classes, we need to sort it in descending order. That looks like this:

```{r}
md_churches |>
  group_by(CITY) |>
  summarise(
    count = n()
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(count))
```

Baltimore, not surprisingly, has the most churches, and it's not close.

We can, if we want, group by more than one thing. The churches data contains a column detailing the five-digit zip code called `zip5`.

We can group by city _and_ zip code, like this:

```{r}
md_churches |>
  group_by(CITY, zip5) |>
  summarise(
    count = n()
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(count))
```

## Other summarization methods: summing, mean, median, min and max

In the last example, we grouped like records together and counted them, but there's so much more we can do to summarize each group.

Let's say we wanted to know the total number of seats offered in each term? For that, we could use the `sum()` function to add up all of the values in the column "seats". We put the column we want to total -- "seats" -- inside the sum() function `sum(seats)`. Note that we can simply add a new summarize function here, keeping our count_classes field in our output table.

```{r}
umd_courses |>
  group_by(term) |>
  summarise(
    count_classes = n(),
    total_seats = sum(seats)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(total_seats))
```

We can also calculate the average number of seats for each department -- the mean -- and the number that sits at the midpoint of our data -- the median.

```{r}
umd_courses |>
  group_by(term) |>
  summarise(
    count_classes = n(),
    total_seats = sum(seats),
    mean_seats = mean(seats),
    median_seats = median(seats)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(total_seats))
```

We see something interesting here. The mean number of seats is higher than the median number in most cases, but the difference isn't always huge. In some cases the mean gets skewed by larger or lower amounts. Examining both the median -- which is less sensitive to extreme values -- and the mean -- which is more sensitive to extreme values -- gives you a clearer picture of the composition of the data.

What about the highest and lowest number of seats for each department? For that, we can use the `min()` and `max()` functions.

```{r}
umd_courses |>
  group_by(department) |>
  summarise(
    count_classes = n(),
    total_seats = sum(seats),
    mean_seats = mean(seats),
    median_seats = median(seats),
    min_seats = min(seats),
    max_seats = max(seats)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(total_seats))
```

From this, we can see that every department has courses with 0 seats listed. We'll need to account for those in any analysis, probably by excluding them. The variation in mean and median seats is interesting, too: look at Mathematics and English compared to Computer Science and Engineering, for example. These patterns aren't random: departments make choices about the courses they offer.

It would be interesting to see what the course with the largest number of seats is. To do that, we could simply take our original data set and sort it from highest to lowest on seats

```{r}
umd_courses |>
  arrange(desc(seats))
```

UNIV100 and ENES140 have a LOT of seats. Are they virtual classes? Hybrid? What else could we ask of this data?
